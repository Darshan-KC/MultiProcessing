# multiprocessing module provides Array and Value objects to share data between processes.
# 1. Array: a ctypes array allocated from shared memory.
# 2. Value: a ctypes object allocated from shared memory.
# Given below is a simple example showing use of Array and Value for sharing data between processes.
