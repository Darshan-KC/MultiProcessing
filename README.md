## Introduction

Multiprocessing is a technique in Python that allows you to execute multiple processes simultaneously, taking full advantage of multiple CPU cores. This can significantly enhance the performance of CPU-bound tasks by parallelizing their execution.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Darshan-KC/MultiProcessing.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd MultiProcessing
```

## Features

- **Basic Concepts**: Introduction to multiprocessing and its benefits.
- **Process Management**: Creating and managing multiple processes.
- **Inter-Process Communication**: Techniques for communication between processes.
- **Synchronization**: Ensuring proper synchronization between processes.
- **Real-World Examples**: Practical applications of multiprocessing.

## Examples

Here are some example scripts included in this repository:
